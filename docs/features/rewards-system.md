# Rewards System

## Overview

The Rewards System enables users to create, manage, and track achievement-based incentives throughout their challenge journey. Users can set up meaningful rewards tied to their progress, create proof of achievement, and maintain motivation through structured positive reinforcement.

## What are Rewards

### Core Workflow

1. **Reward Planning**: Create planned rewards for future achievements
2. **Activation**: Mark rewards as active when ready to pursue them
3. **Achievement Tracking**: Record when rewards are earned with optional proof
4. **Progress Monitoring**: View reward statistics and achievement history
5. **Proof Documentation**: Link evidence of reward completion for accountability

### Key Components

- **Reward Cards**: Visual representation of each reward with status indicators
- **Status Management**: Three-tier system (Planned → Active → Achieved)
- **Proof System**: Optional URL linking to evidence of reward completion
- **Achievement Dialog**: Interface for marking rewards as achieved
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Overview of total, achieved, and planned rewards

## Business Value
