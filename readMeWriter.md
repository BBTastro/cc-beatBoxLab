## LLM Instructions for Using This Template

### Step 1: Gather Project Information
Before writing the README, collect the following information:

1. **Project Name and Purpose**: What does this project do?
2. **Key Features**: List 3-7 main features with brief descriptions
3. **Technology Stack**: What technologies, frameworks, and tools are used?
4. **Prerequisites**: What needs to be installed to run this project?
5. **Setup Steps**: What are the main steps to get the project running?

9. **Available Scripts**: What npm/yarn scripts are available?
10. **Deployment**: How is this project deployed?

### Step 2: Customize the Template
Replace the placeholder content with project-specific information:

- Replace `[Project Name]` with the actual project name
